# PatchManagementTool Documentation

## Introduction

The `PatchManagementTool` is a Python-based utility designed to manage software patches in an enterprise environment. It scans systems to identify outdated software and handles automatic deployment of security patches.

## Getting Started

First, import the `PatchManagementTool` class from its Python module:

```python
from patch_management_tool import PatchManagementTool
```

## Basic Usage

Create an instance of `PatchManagementTool` by providing the authentication method and details as arguments:

```python
auth_method = 'api_key'
auth_details = {'api_key': 'your_api_key'}

patch_tool = PatchManagementTool(auth_method, auth_details)
```

Currently, the `PatchManagementTool` supports these authentication methods:

- Basic authentication ('basic')
- API key authentication ('api_key')
- OAuth ('oauth')

The `auth_details` should be a dictionary containing the necessary details for your chosen method of authentication.

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Authenticating with an API

The `authenticate` method is used to authenticate with the software provider's API. Here is how you would call it:

```python
patch_tool.authenticate()
```

Please note that this is a stub method. The actual implementation depends on the specific API and authentication method.

## Command-line Arguments or Parameters

Currently, the `PatchManagementTool` does not support command-line arguments. All interactions should be done within your Python code.

## Expected Output Examples

The `PatchManagementTool` does not provide any output at this stage, as the `authenticate` method is a stub and needs to be implemented.

## Advanced Usage Scenarios

In advanced scenarios where you might want to implement different authentication methods, you would need to modify the `authenticate` method. Here's an example of how you could implement basic authentication:

```python
def authenticate(self):
    if self.auth_method == 'basic':
        username = self.auth_details['username']
        password = self.auth_details['password']
        
        # Implementation of basic authentication using username and password
        # This is just a placeholder and will not work in a real scenario
```

Remember to replace the placeholder comments with your actual implementation, depending on the specifics of the API you are authenticating with.

In an enterprise environment, you might also want to consider extending the `PatchManagementTool` class to include methods for scanning systems, identifying outdated software, and deploying patches.

## Conclusion

The `PatchManagementTool` provides a robust foundation for managing software patches in an enterprise environment. By extending and customizing the class to suit your specific needs, you can create a powerful tool that keeps your systems secure and up-to-date.

# Patch Management Tool API Documentation

This document describes the PatchManagementTool library API, which is designed to manage software patches in an enterprise environment. The tool scans enterprise systems to identify outdated software and manages the automatic deployment of security patches.

## Class: PatchManagementTool

This class embodies the main functionality of the tool. It is in charge of managing software patches in an enterprise environment.

### `__init__(self, auth_method: str, auth_details: Dict[str, str])`

This method is used to initialize the PatchManagementTool object.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| auth_method | str | The authentication method to use. It can be either 'basic', 'api_key', or 'oauth'. |
| auth_details | Dict[str, str] | A dictionary containing the authentication details. The contents of this dictionary will depend on the authentication method used. |

#### Example

```python
auth_details = {'api_key': 'your-api-key'}
tool = PatchManagementTool('api_key', auth_details)
```

### `authenticate(self)`

This method authenticates the PatchManagementTool object with the software provider's API using the specified method and details. It is currently a stub method. The actual implementation would depend on the specific API and authentication method.

#### Parameters

This method doesn't take any parameters.

#### Example

```python
tool.authenticate()
```

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

- Always remember to initialize the `PatchManagementTool` object with the correct authentication method and details before calling the `authenticate()` method.
- The `authenticate()` method should always be called before making any requests to the software provider's API. This ensures that the tool has the necessary permissions to carry out its tasks.
- Remember to replace the `authenticate()` stub with an implementation that matches your specific use case.
- Always handle any exceptions that might arise when calling the `authenticate()` method. This helps prevent your application from crashing unexpectedly.

## Error Handling

At this point, error handling isn't implemented in the code. However, when implementing the `authenticate()` method, it's important to handle any errors that might occur during the authentication process. This could be done by wrapping the authentication logic in a try/except block and handling any exceptions that might arise. The type of exceptions you handle will depend on the specific API and authentication method you're using.
